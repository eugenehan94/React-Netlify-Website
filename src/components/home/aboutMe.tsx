        Hello! My name is Eugene and I enjoy creating things that live on the
        internet. My interest in web development started back in 2009 in
        highschool. I took my first computer science course where it was mainly
        Java, but had moments of HTML and CSS. This lead me to further pursue
        Javascript and then React and Angular.

      <Typography>
        Fast-foward to today, I had the privilage of creating countless
        projects, contribute to opening source, and contribute my expertise to
        businesses.
